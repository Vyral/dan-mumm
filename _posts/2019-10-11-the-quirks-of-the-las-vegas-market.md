Whether you’re looking to move to Las Vegas from out of state or you’re a current resident looking to sell your home, our market is different from other real estate markets in several ways that you should take note of.&nbsp;

First of all, **the percentage of owner-occupied homes is very low compared to other areas.** There are a lot of vacation homeowners and investors who own properties in our market, which means a lot more rental homes and vacant homes dotting the landscape.&nbsp;

Second, **our market isn’t very seasonal, which brings me to my next point: Las Vegas is a very transient city.** In other words, people move in and out at a quicker rate than normal. On average, Las Vegas residents move every three years, while the national average is about seven years.&nbsp;

Because of this, school zones aren’t as important in our market as they are in other markets. They’re still very important when it comes to higher-priced homes, but not so when it comes to condos and entry-level homes. Our status as a very transient city also means homes aren’t really prepped for sale like they are in other markets, which can be frustrating for out-of-town buyers who expect all listed homes to be prepped and staged.&nbsp;

On the financial side of things, another notable difference is that you don’t need an attorney in our market in order to sell. Most often, people just use their Realtor and/or the title and escrow company to facilitate the transaction.&nbsp;

Lastly, **the contracts for our home purchases are heavily favored toward buyers.** By this I mean there are no real financial tie-downs to the option period. If you’re buying a house, you can cancel at any time, for any reason, with no penalties. We wish contracts were more balanced between buyers and sellers, but that’s the reality of the situation.&nbsp;

If you have any more questions about what makes our Las Vegas market different from other markets or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home here soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&nbsp;
