I’m often asked by sellers how much value a pool will add to a house. This is the perfect time to discuss this question because it’s pretty hot here in Las Vegas—I’m building a pool in my backyard even now.&nbsp;

In real estate school, they teach you that a pool adds about 10% of the value to a house as compared to one without a pool. This is oversimplified to the point of being inaccurate. I can tell the difference between a seasoned Realtor and a new one based on whether or not they say this.

So how do you determine how much value a pool adds?

One of the most important factors is **whether the home and its lot are conducive to building a pool.** If you have a small lot and the pool would take up most of the yard, it’s not conducive to building a pool, which means that it wouldn’t add as much value.

Another factor to consider is **the layout of the house**. Our house has plenty of windows in the back that overlook the pool area; a modern-style house with good sight lines to the backyard is much more conducive to building a pool (and adding value) than an older house without lines of sight.

More externally, **the market also plays a role in dictating how much value a pool adds to a home.** If you live in an area where no houses have pools, making you the only pool owner, that will increase the value of the pool. On the other hand, it’s worth considering why there are no houses with pools. It could be that you’re living in an area where the houses aren’t conducive to building one, or that you’re in an entry-level market area where first-time buyers aren’t willing to pay for them. That’s more of a negative than a positive.

The final factor the determines a pool’s value is **the quality of the pool itself**. What are the finishes? A Pebble Tec interior finish is much more durable and will last about 20 years, whereas the average plaster finish will probably not last that long at all. And if the pool equipment is just stuck somewhere in the backyard, clearly visible, that’s a good way to tell that it’s not well done. It will cost a bit more to keep the pool equipment tucked away in a separate area where it’s neither visible or audible, but that’s how you can tell if a pool has been professionally done.

Hopefully this has been informative to you\! If you have any questions about this or other real estate topics, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to speak with you.
