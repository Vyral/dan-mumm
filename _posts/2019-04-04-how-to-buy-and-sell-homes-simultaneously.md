Most home sellers are also homebuyers. **When it comes to buying a house and selling a house at the same time, the first thing you need to do is speak with your lender.** A lot of times, people will put their home on the market without realizing that they can’t qualify for another loan or maybe they have some credit issues that they weren’t aware of.

**There are really two ways to go about this.** You can either buy a new house before you sell your current one, or you could sell your house and try to find another one at the same time.

The easiest and most stress-free strategy is to buy your new home first. This eliminates moving timeframes, having to rush, and other logistical problems. The difficulty here is that most people can’t afford it or can’t qualify for two mortgages at once.&nbsp;

**If you need to sell first in order to buy your new home, the first thing you should do is list your home for sale at an appropriate price.** Even if you found the perfect house and wanted to write an offer on it, most sellers won’t consider your contingent offer if your home isn’t even listed yet. If you have your home on the market and find a buyer, sellers are much more likely to accept a contingent offer.&nbsp;

Once you are ready to move, you have a few different options. You could do a rent-back, where you rent your home back for a short period of time from the buyer and have a month or two to move from your current home into your new one.&nbsp;

Another thing we can do is a concurrent close, where both transactions close on the same day. **That rushes your move a bit, but it’s definitely something we can do.**
