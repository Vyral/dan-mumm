Now that May has come and gone, it’s time to talk about the positive developments we saw in and around our Las Vegas market.&nbsp;

Let’s get right into the numbers:&nbsp;

Between April and May this year, **our number of closings shot up from 3,500 to 3,900—a 10% increase.**

Another increase we saw was in the average home price: In April, homes in our market were valued at around $310,000 on average. Just a month later, **the average Las Vegas home appreciated by 5% and was worth $325,000.&nbsp;**

Interestingly, **the number of new listings to hit our market this past month rose to 5,900** as well, continuing the recent trend of our market’s inventory keeping pace with buyer demand. This is good news for both buyers and sellers because, while there are more homes for buyers to pick from, sellers also aren’t having much trouble getting their home sold in this market.&nbsp;

While we’ve seen some dramatic increases in some areas, the number of days homes spent on the market remained relatively unchanged. **The average Las Vegas home spent 43 days on market in April compared to a slightly lower 42 days in May. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**

It’s not just sellers who have much to gain from our current market conditions, though. Not only has there been an influx in inventory, but interest rates have reached a 17-month low. **Between conventional loans and investment property loans, rates are right around 4% and 4.5%, respectively.&nbsp;**

Even if you purchased a home at a still-low 5% rate in the last couple of years, it might behoove you to consider refinancing while this window of opportunity lasts.&nbsp;
