The month of May didn’t show much change for our overall real estate market, but this lack of change is significant in and of itself. Why? Well, a steady market holds plenty of opportunity for buyers and sellers alike, meaning now is a great time to pursue your real estate goals.&nbsp;

**With that in mind, let’s review a few key numbers.**

4,100 properties went under contract, which is nearly the same as we saw in the previous month, but the number of closings increased dramatically—going up by almost 50% since March. This jump appears to come as a rebound from the low buyer activity we observed earlier this year.

And, as a result of this increased buyer activity, homes are now spending an average of 44 days on the market. This constitutes a slight decrease from recent trends. The average sales price has also dropped, going down to $310,000.

**In other words, it’s a great time to make a move.** If you have any other question or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&nbsp;
