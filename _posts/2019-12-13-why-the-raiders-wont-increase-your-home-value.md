A few months ago, I sent out a video about the incoming Las Vegas Raiders NFL football team and its impact on the housing market here. I got great responses—some folks agreeing with me, others not so much—so I decided to do another video about what everyone seems to be discussing.

I’ve been getting this question a lot: “**Are the Raiders going to increase the value of my home?**” I wanted to take some time to explain why, in reality, it probably won’t happen that way.&nbsp;

Naturally, the real estate market is speculative, meaning that people are basing buying and selling decisions not just on what happens right this second, but what’s going to happen in the future.&nbsp;

An example of speculation: If a pharmaceutical company announces a miracle drug that could cure cancer, that company’s stock is going to skyrocket. Even before anything is officially announced, word of the research and development of such a drug getting out could shoot stocks up.&nbsp;

The key here is that the stocks increased upon the announcement, not the actual release of the drug. If you wait until the release, you may have missed the boat entirely—stocks could actually be plummeting by then for a variety of reasons.&nbsp;

Real estate is the same way; **when there was a general buzz about the stadium being built for the Raiders in 2015 and 2016, that’s when speculation affected prices the most.&nbsp;**

This means that the pricing that you have now is, at least in part, because of the Raiders. You can thank them for that. However, the idea that somehow your property value will increase once the first game is played in Las Vegas is just not realistic.&nbsp;

In studies from other markets that welcomed an NFL team, we see there really isn’t any evidence to claim that post-announcement events, like a stadium’s completion or a team’s first game, have a real impact.

If you have any other Raider-related or real estate questions, give me a call or send me an email. I’m always happy to look at your situation and help you decide what moves make sense.
