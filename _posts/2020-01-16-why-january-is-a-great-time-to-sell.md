<p style="text-align: center;"><em>For the 2020 real estate market, why should we now think of January as the new spring market? Find out today.</em></p>

Why is January now the go-to time for homeowners to list their homes? Usually, there’s a bit of a slowdown in the market over the winter months, but we didn’t really see that over this past holiday season.&nbsp;

The number of homes for sale is a really important metric to look at if you want to understand what’s really going on in the market; **over the last five or six months, the number of homes for sale continuously dropped, and inventory was very low.** This was great news for sellers, who found less competition due to low inventory.&nbsp;

It’s also important to look at the number of new listings coming on the market. The number of new houses on the market is very low; **people are buying homes faster than homes are being supplied to the market.** This is a very favorable condition for those who are thinking of selling.

The final metric to look at is the number of closed sales. During that period, **the number of closed sales actually remained steady**—it even increased a little in December.

So what does this mean overall?

It means that January 2020 is a great time to sell your home. I wouldn’t gamble by waiting until the spring to list, unless you want more competition from all of the other sellers who also list around that time.&nbsp;

So if you’re thinking about selling or you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
