Contrary to popular belief, summertime isn’t necessarily the best time for you to sell a home.&nbsp;

A big reason people assume this is the case is that here in Las Vegas, the number of home sales usually increases every summer. Also, the average days on market for listed homes increases by almost 30% in the winter months compared to the summer months.&nbsp;

However, **when you look at the big picture and take all the key statistics into account, they tell a different story.&nbsp;**

For example, over the past 10 years, the average price per square foot hasn’t changed much from season to season. Also, the number of people trying to sell versus those who are trying to buy, which we measure by the amount of inventory, hasn’t changed from season to season either during this time span. Although fewer people move during the winter months, the overall balance between buyers and sellers doesn’t change.&nbsp;

So, while it probably wouldn’t take you as long to sell during the summer, there’s no guarantee you’ll get a better price or the home sale process will be significantly different than it would be during the fall or winter.&nbsp;

When is the best time to sell, then? **That depends on the market you’re in.** People move in and out of Las Vegas all the time, so it’s not a very seasonal market. If we move into the suburbs or smaller towns, those areas are more seasonal.&nbsp;

Another factor you need to consider is price point. Entry-level homes (e.g., condos or small single-family homes) sell at a similar rate no matter what time of year because demand is so high for them. Luxury homes, on the other hand, are more affected by the seasons because it’s mostly families who buy and sell them.&nbsp;

**Instead of looking at the seasons to determine the best time to sell, look at your micro market**, which encompasses what’s happening in your specific neighborhood. General market trends might not affect you as much as what’s going on in your specific subdivision. Some neighborhoods in Las Vegas average one month of inventory, while others average as much as 17 months. If there are no available listings in your neighborhood, it’s probably a good time to sell. If there are a lot, you might want to wait a little bit.&nbsp;
