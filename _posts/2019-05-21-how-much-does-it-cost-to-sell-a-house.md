People often ask us how much it costs to sell a home. Most Realtors assume people already know the answer, but a lot of people don’t because they’ve never sold a house before.&nbsp;

**It doesn’t really cost you anything up front to sell your home.** The costs you incur are paid at closing and are typically removed from whatever amount the home sells for. The only fees that you might have to pay include repair fees or to order HOA rules and regulations. Other than that, the rest of the costs happen at closing after you’ve sold.

The main home selling cost is your commission. **This can range anywhere from 5% to 7%** depending on your location, the type of property you have, and more. This commission is typically split right down the middle between your agent and the buyer’s agent.

Different agents charge different commission rates, but some include different services with that commission. For example, I can pay for staging for my clients, as well as a notary, with my commission. Some agents charge a low commission but charge higher broker fees or administrative fees.

Your closing costs will probably be around 1% to 1.5% of your sale price and they will cover things such as your title and escrow fees, your title policy, HOA documents, transfer taxes in certain states, and whatever you owe on your mortgage.&nbsp;

**All in all, it typically costs you about 8% of your sale price to sell your home.** If you sell with a company like Opendoor or another iBuyer that will give you an instant offer, you’re going to sell for at least 10% below market value. They’re buying to make a profit, and you won’t typically net the most money this way.
