<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The holidays are a great time to list and there are four main reasons why.</em></p>

Contrary to what you might have heard, winter is actually a great time to put your home up for sale. Many assume that waiting until after the holidays will work to their advantage, but **there are four reasons that selling during the winter months instead can be the better option:&nbsp;**

**1\. Supply is low and demand is high.** Because so many people fall for the myth that our market is inactive over the winter, few sellers actually make the move to list their home. This means those who do have the unique opportunity to stand out above the crowd and enjoy the higher demand that comes along with the seasonally depleted supply. Waiting until spring, however, will only leave sellers pitted against a much higher level of competition.&nbsp;

**2\. Our Las Vegas market doesn’t rely much on seasonality.** Excluding certain high-end real estate markets, people move to and from our area year-round.&nbsp;

**3\. People have more free time around the holidays.** Despite the amount of time we tend to spend with loved ones at this time of year, many of us also have plenty of time off from work. This gives sellers more availability for showings and buyers fewer scheduling constraints when they’re out searching for the perfect property.&nbsp;

**4\. Buyers are more serious during the holiday season.** Unlike in the spring and summer, “looky-loos” (so-called “buyers” who are more interested in snooping around open houses than actually submitting offers) are very rare in the winter months. This is because those who choose to move around the holidays usually have strong motivations to do so. Therefore, sellers with homes on the market during this season can rest assured that the buyers who approach them are most likely ready to strike a deal.&nbsp;
