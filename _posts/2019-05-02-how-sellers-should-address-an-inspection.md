Many people wonder what a repair response is and how to deal with one. A repair response is the first step taken after a buyer and seller agree on a price and go under contract. The buyer does an inspection and asks the seller to fix the items that come up.

When we were still in a seller’s market, buyers were pretty much left to make their own repairs—if sellers didn’t like the response, they could simply deny the offer altogether. **Now, however, buyers have a lot more negotiating power and expect more repairs to be done.**

Therefore, buyers know what is generally asked for and sellers know when to counter a repair item. Here are some of the reasonable requests we see:

**1\. Health and safety issues.** Think of a garage door with loose hinges, or something that could be a threat for a child or person living in the home.&nbsp;

**2\. Things that aren’t immediately noticeable.** If there’s a leak under a kitchen sink or in the roof, it’s reasonable for a buyer to expect a fix.&nbsp;

We don’t want to see repair responses for things that are immediately obvious when walking through a house. Let’s say there’s a missing closet door in the house—this is something the buyer knows when they write the offer. So, as a buyer, it’s much better to put items like these in your initial offer when you purchase the home. It’s more difficult to ask later because the seller may feel like you’re going back on your word.&nbsp;
