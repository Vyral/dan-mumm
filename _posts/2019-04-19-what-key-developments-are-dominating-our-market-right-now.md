With March in the books and April continuing along, it’s time for an update on our Las Vegas market.

From the end of 2018 to the start of this year, our market settled into a slowdown that raised some concerns among many. Questions swirled around the economy and interest rates, there was little buyer activity, and inventory grew.

This past March, some interesting developments came about in the market. **Inventory shot up from 3,300 to 4,100 listings year over year—a 29% increase** that, on its own, might seem like cause for concern. To make matters more interesting, though, buyer activity increased as well, and this served to offset some of those new listings coming onto the market.

Mirroring our inventory rise, **our total number of closed transactions also hit a 29% jump, going from 2,400 to 3,100.**

What does all of this mean?

**More homes are, indeed, coming on the market, but buyer demand is increasingly becoming a factor as well, serving as a counterbalance to our influx in inventory.**

Overall, these conditions make for a great market and create more of a normalized environment between buyers and sellers.

As a final note, **our days on market has remained mostly unchanged and sits at 48 days.** Something to keep in mind: If your home is around the $300,000 price point, the number of days your home would spend on the market is significantly lower.
