<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Believe it or not, I’m here to share four good reasons a person may have for not buying a house.</em></p>

Today I want to talk to you about why not to buy a house. And before you ask, no, folks, I promise I haven’t gone totally crazy; there’s a perfectly logical reason why I, a Realtor, would talk to you about reasons not to buy a house.&nbsp;

First, I think it’s unhealthy as a businessperson to assume that every single person is a good fit for my product or service. Some people should buy a house, others shouldn’t. My job is to service those who already know that buying a house is the right decision for them—not twist the arm of those who don’t want to buy.&nbsp;

Real estate is widely believed to be a good investment because, if you hold onto property long enough, it will eventually increase in value. This is true, but what about inflation? **If your house appreciates, but at a slower rate than inflation, the value increase may be negligible.&nbsp;**

In fact, when adjusted for inflation, property appreciation rates over the last 30 to 40 years are rather underwhelming—1% to 2% a year. Now, of course, if you buy in good locations, then you can really start making appreciation work for you. But unfortunately, scoping out ‘steals and deals’ (buying a cheaper property in bad locations) is how all too many homebuyers approach the process.&nbsp;

Another factor to consider is that there are a lot of capital expenses (aka deferred maintenance) &nbsp;that come with owning a home. Building up equity always seems better than hurling money at rent, but what happens when a few years down the line a huge repair is needed? If you built up $10,000 in equity, but your recent roof replacement cost you $10,000, equity becomes a moot point.&nbsp;

Then there’s risk. For example, if you bought a home in Vegas in 2006 or 2007, you’re still underwater on your home in 2019; almost 14 years later, your house still isn’t worth what you paid for it. Though that’s an extreme example, it proves that **we cannot blindly assume that your property will always be worth more in the future.&nbsp;**

Lastly, consider that our economy and society have shifted to favor more mobility. People move around more now than they ever have before, for all sorts of different reasons. Not wanting to be tied down permanently has become a cultural norm.&nbsp;

Don’t forget that the reasons you should consider buying a house remain equally compelling. First, owning a home offers long-term stability. If you see yourself being planted for 10 to 15 years and desire that long-term control, you’ll only get it through the security of ownership; even a long-term lease carries too much uncertainty. Secondly, if you have pets, or need to be able to customize your living space to your specific style and needs, then ownership will be best.&nbsp;
