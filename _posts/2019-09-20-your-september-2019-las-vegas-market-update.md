**What’s happening in our Las Vegas market so far this September?&nbsp;**

We’ll keep today’s update short, as the numbers for this month are pretty similar to the earlier summer months. One of the changes worth noting, though, has been our level of inventory. Back in July, inventory reached a peak with roughly 10,000 homes listed on the market. After hitting its peak, **our supply decreased from 9,700 to 9,600 in August and September, respectively.**

The number of new listings coming on the market has remained relatively unchanged at around 5,000. We’ve had 3,900 homes go under contract so far this month, which is also comparable to the previous two months—4,100 in August and 3,800 in July.&nbsp;

Days on market is another area where we’re we’ve seen a bit of a change recently. **This month, the average Las Vegas home is spending 46 days on the market, compared to just 40 or 41 days in the last couple of months.** And actually, that slight bump in time on market is present across all price points right now. If you’re a seller, take note that despite the fact that prices haven’t increased (which I’ll touch on in a moment), days on market have, so it might take a little longer to sell your home at the moment. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

Let’s turn our attention to home prices, which, as I mentioned, have stayed pretty level over the last few months. In July, prices were right around $321,000, before rising to $326,000 the next month and coming down to $321,000 again this month.&nbsp;

As one final note, **we’re expecting the Fed to announce another rate cut in the days ahead, so keep an eye on that**, as it will likely mean lower mortgage rates.&nbsp;
