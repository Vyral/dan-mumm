Almost all of my sellers ask me what they should do to prepare their home before listing it, as well as what they shouldn’t do.&nbsp;

There’s a lot of confusion around this topic, and it’s no mystery why; many Realtors suggest wildly different things to their sellers. And while I’d love to give a simple, clear answer to the question, it does depend on a lot of factors, which I’ll discuss today.

1. **Market conditions.** In a strong seller’s market, you don’t really need to do much; if there’s little inventory and no competition, you could price your home reasonably and it would sell no matter what. This was pretty much the case for the Las Vegas market up until the end of 2018, when we started to see a shift in prices.
2. **Price point.** In the average price point, you don’t really need to do a whole lot to sell a house, whereas in the higher price points ($400,000 and up), the condition of the house becomes more and more of a factor.
3. **The selling standards of the neighborhood.** If everyone in a neighborhood has granite countertops and you have tile countertops, that will significantly hurt you when it comes to the sale. If all the homes in your neighborhood are renovated and cleaned up before they sell, you might need to do that yourself, even though other factors may suggest otherwise.
4. **The resources at the seller’s disposal.** Do you have the money or the skills to make the necessary changes? If you don’t have the resources to do anything, then you’ll just have to use whatever strategies are available. Ask your Realtor for their input and take their approach.

Now, if you have limited resources, what should you do to get your home ready for sale? Here’s my personal list:

1. **Declutter.** The more personal items you can remove from the main living areas, the better. It also doesn’t cost you anything\!
2. **Paint.** Generally, painting is very inexpensive. The entire interior of a house can cost around $2,000 to repaint, but it dramatically changes the perception of your home.
3. **Boost curb appeal.** First impressions are everything in real estate. Do whatever you can to make a potential buyer’s first look at your home as good as possible. If you can clean up your front yard and update your landscaping, you’ll go far in your sale.
4. **Eliminate odors.** If you have pets in your home or the smell of cigarettes, it’ll turn buyers off your listing. However, these odors are relatively easy to get rid of, though they might require some research.

If you have any questions about today’s topics, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.
