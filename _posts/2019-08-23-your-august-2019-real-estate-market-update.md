Some say that the market is great, yet others maintain that it’s terrible. With these conflicting perspectives, it’s hard to tell what’s actually going on. In today’s update, I’ll hopefully clear up any misconceptions about the state of our market.&nbsp;

**Our numbers reveal the truth:**

* The average home price is $326,000. This is down slightly from July, where it was $321,000, and roughly the same as it was in June—not a huge change in the grand scheme of things.
* Our average days on market is 43 days currently; the average was 41 days in July and 42 in June.

Overall, we have a good, balanced, and healthy market. **So why are people so confused?**

I think the reason is because Las Vegas had a very unusual market for the last five to six years. We saw a ridiculous amount of growth here; every year we kept skyrocketing in price, with some areas seeing 7% to 10% appreciation per year. Sellers gained a ton of equity and homes were selling in two or three days with multiple offers. We experienced this from 2013 to 2018, and now that the market has balanced out, expectations are still where they were two or three years ago.

**Ultimately, there’s no real cause for concern.** Another important thing to note is that interest rates are very, very low right now: everyone with a mortgage should consider refinancing to lock in a low rate. I just did it myself, in fact.

As a final note, understand that **a home’s condition is becoming increasingly significant to buyers.** Two or three years ago, if a property was priced correctly, its condition wasn’t too important. Today, however, even lower-priced properties need to be in good condition to sell quickly. Buyers are having a tough time seeing past a home that doesn’t look its best, so it’s beneficial for sellers to consider staging, recarpeting, and adding a fresh coat of paint before they put it on the market.

If you have any other questions about the market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon\!
