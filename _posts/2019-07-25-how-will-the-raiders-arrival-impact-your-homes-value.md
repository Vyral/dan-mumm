Will the arrival of the Las Vegas Raiders double the value of your house?

**As much as I’d love to say yes, the answer is probably not, and there are a few reasons why.&nbsp;**

First of all, the jobs that were created to build their new stadium are mostly temporary. On top of that, they’re mostly lower-income jobs that don’t have a huge impact on the economy.&nbsp;

Second, we’ve already experienced most of the home appreciation caused by their relocation since it was announced a couple years ago. It’s not as if the economy is waiting to explode after kickoff during the first game. A big part of real estate investing revolves around speculation, and when there’s a big news item like that announced, that’s when you see that increase in demand.&nbsp;

Why is our Las Vegas market doing so well if it’s not because of the Raiders, then? **A few key factors are driving our economy that have a far greater impact.**

The first is its overall diversification. Back in—say—2006 and 2007, Las Vegas was primarily an entertainment-based economy, but that’s changed a lot in the last few years. Many notable tech companies such as Amazon have moved here, and they’ve brought in thousands of employees for more permanent, high-income jobs. These jobs, in turn, bring in more families.&nbsp;

Tax changes in California and a steady migration from the West Coast and the Northeast are two more factors that have contributed to the health of our economy, so while I wish I could say the Raiders are going to double your home’s value, their arrival is still good news for our market.&nbsp;
