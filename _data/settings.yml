  about_markdown: |
    1. I ANSWER MY PHONE! All calls, texts, and emails returned in 2 business hours (MAX), 1/week PROGRESS REPORT by phone.

    2. Your home sold, GUARANTEED. I put my money where my mouth is. If you are not 100% satisfied, I will give you back my commission. No questions asked.

    3. NO BINDING CONTRACTS. Most brokers are not willing to do whatever it takes to sell a listing quickly, so they lock you into a 6-month or 1-year contract.  I allow my clients to cancel my listings anytime because I know that I ALWAYS overdeliver! (By the way - I have never been fired from a listing!)

    4. I SHOW my own listings. Ever hear the saying, "give the best job to the busiest man?". As a full-time professional closing more deals than 99% of agents, I do whatever it takes to match up my buyers and sellers. I don't rely on other brokers by throwing your home on the MLS and waiting.

    5. YOUR INTERESTS FIRST. ALWAYS. The problem with hiring a low-producing agent? They'll tell you whatever you want to hear out of desperation! As a top-producing agent, I have plenty of business and can be completely honest with you. If I don't think I can help you, or if moving forward on a deal isn't in your best interest, I'LL TELL YOU.
